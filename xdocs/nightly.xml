    <h2>What are the nightly builds?</h2>
    <p>
    The nightly builds are interim builds that are <b>untested and unsupported</b>.
    <i>Use at your own risk!</i>
    <br/>
    These unreleased builds may not even load, may have undocumented features, 
    known defects, and any number of other issues.
    <br/>
    They are intended for use by developers and others wishing to help with resolving JMeter bugs.
    </p>
    <note><b>These builds should not be used in production.</b></note>

    <h2>Where are the nightly builds?</h2>
    <p>JMeter CI builds are currently run by Jenkins and Buildbot</p>
    <p>These are located at:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://builds.apache.org/job/JMeter-trunk/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/trunk/dist/">Last Successful Jenkins build for JMeter-trunk</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://ci.apache.org/projects/jmeter/nightlies/">Buildbot nightly builds for JMeter-trunk</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/jmeter/">Maven Snapshots (Buildbot nightly builds)</a></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>What do they consist of?</h2>
<p>
JMeter is distributed as a set of zip (or tar-gz) archive files as are the released versions.
You can find the bundles:
<ul>
<li>apache-jmeter-{SVN revision}.zip - Bundle in ZIP format</li>
<li>apache-jmeter-{SVN revision}.tgz - Bundle in TAR GZIP format</li>
<li>apache-jmeter-{SVN revision}_src.zip - Sources in ZIP format</li>
<li>apache-jmeter-{SVN revision}_src.tgz - Sources in TAR GZIP format</li>
</ul>
For each file you will also find a hash (MD5, SHA) that allows you to test its integrity.
</p>

<h2>Using the nightly builds</h2>
<p>Just unzip the bundle and use it as you would use any release.</p>

<h2>Warning - please note!</h2>
<note>
    <span style="font-size : large">
    <b>The nightly builds may or may not work properly - or at all.</b>
    </span>
</note>
<p>
    If there is a problem with a particular version, 
    it is worth reporting this on the JMeter-dev mailing list and/or open a bug and/or trying again in a day or two.
