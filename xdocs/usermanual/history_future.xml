<subsection name="&sect-num;.1 History" anchor="history">
<p>Stefano Mazzocchi of the Apache Software Foundation was the original developer of JMeter.
He wrote it primarily to test the performance of Apache JServ (a project that has
since been replaced by the Apache Tomcat project).  We redesigned JMeter to enhance the GUI
and to add functional-testing capabilities.
</p>

<p>JMeter became a Top Level Apache project in November 2011, which means it has a Project Management Committee and a dedicated website.</p>

<subsection name="&sect-num;.2 The Future" anchor="future">
<p>We hope to see JMeter's capabilities rapidly expand as developers take advantage of its
pluggable architecture. <br/>
The primary goal of further developments will be:
<ul>
<li>Support of HTTP/2 protocol</li>
<li>Possible rework of core architecture to introduce a pool of threads or switch to async model allowing us to take advantage of async io</li>
<li>Enhancements to Webservices protocols (REST / SOAP)</li>
<li>Enhancements to JMS protocol implementation</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>
